Hello there,
I would like to report the followin issue

Summary

An escalation of privileges exist in Bitdefender and has been tested against Bitdefender Free Edition 1.0.16.157 Engine Version 7.83921 . The EoP allows a low priviledge user to gain access as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM .
The exploitation has been tested in installation of BitDefender on Windows 10 1909 (OS Build 18363.719) 64bit .

Description

The exploitation allows any local, low privilege user, to change the DACL of any chosen file. The access you obtain depends on which file you are going to backdoor/overwrite. 
In the PoC i overwrite the file system32/wermgr.exe and i gain a cmd.exe running as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM . 
The exploitation works with the default installation of Bitdefender.
When the Bitdefender detects a threat, it gives the ability to the user to choose what action to take. The user can choose to Quarantine the threat. After the threat has been placed in Quarantine, the user can choose to restore it. The problem arises because the Bitdefeder restores the file as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM and without impersonating the current user. This allows the user to create a symlink and restore the file to an arbitrary location or overwrite files which are running as SYSTEM.

In order to exploit the issue you have to perform the following steps:
1. Put an EICAR file (or any other file which is going to be detected as a threat) under an empty folder which you fully control. As for example, put an EICAR file to C:\Users\Public\Music
2. Scan the EICAR file (e.g C:\Users\Public\Music\eicar.txt) with the bitdefender.
3. When the bitdefender will detect the threat, choose to Quarantine the file.
4. Give sometime to the bitdefender and rename the folder C:\Users\Public\Music to C:\Users\Public\Music2 .
5. Create the symlink C:\Users\Public\Music\eicar.txt (e.g with the CreateSymlink.exe from symboliclink-testing-tools of project zero) and target the file you wish to control. For example CreateSymlink.exe C:\Users\Public\Music\eicar.txt c:\windows\system32\wermgr.exe .
6. Add the c:\windows\system32\wermgr.exe to the exception list of BitDefender.
5. Go back to BitDefender and restore the C:\Users\Public\Music\eicar.txt . The first time it may fail. Click restore again.
7. The Bitdefender, as an NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, will follow the symlink and will overwrite the file c:\windows\system32\wermgr.exe . 
8. The c:\windows\system32\wermgr.exe will have a new DACL, which gives to your user full access. You can overwrite the file with anything you wish.

Video PoC Step By Step
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note 1: The exploit takes 2 arguments. The second argument is the file we want to overwrite. The first argument, is the file with wich we want to overwrite it. As for example the execution:

Exploit.exe C:\users\attacker\Desktop\1.exe c:\windows\system32\wermgr.exe

will overwrite the file c:\windows\system32\wermgr.exe with the file C:\users\attacker\Desktop\1.exe .
Note 2: The 1.exe is irrelavant to the exploitation. You can choose any file you wish and you can override any file you like. the 1.exe will just execute the cmd.exe to the current user's session. For example you can execute 

Exploit.exe C:\users\attacker\Desktop\test.txt c:\windows\system32\wermgr.exe

and you will overwrite the c:\windows\system32\wermgr.exe with the file C:\users\attacker\Desktop\test.txt
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
00:00 - 00:56: I present the environment. The low privilege user, the windows version, the bitdefender version and the DACL of the file c:\windows\system32\wermgr.exe . As we can see the user attacker has no access over the file.
00:56 - 01:33: We run the exploit and the first thing we have to do is to add as an exception the file we target. In this case the file c:\windows\system32\wermgr.exe
01:33 - 02:17: After we add the exception, we go back to the exploit and we press ENTER. After the ENTER button is pressed, the exploit should present as with three lines which inform us about the AV. At this point the exploit has creted the EICAR file under the  C:\Users\Public\Music\ folder. We go to this folder and we scan the file. We opt to move it to the Quarantine. Until this point, there is no reason for the exploit to fail. It just creates the EICAR file. If you do not see the three lines which are presented in the video and inform you about the AV, ensure you have pressed the ENTER a few times.
02:17 - 03:40: At this point the exploit checks that the EICAR file has been removed. In 30" more or less you should see the message "I go for a cofee. Give me a sec." . If for some reason you don't see the message after a few seconds, press ENTER a few times inside the Exploit window. 
After this message, the Exploit renames the folder C:\Users\Public\Music to C:\Users\Public\Music2 and there is a sleep for 50" . If you won't see the second message "I am back. Oh no the bell. BRB." after 50" - 60" just press ENTER again in the exploit window.
03:40 - 03:48: After the message "I am back. Oh no the bell. BRB." the exploit creates the Symlink. It will create the symlink C:\Users\Public\Music\RESTORE_ME__***.txt which targets the c:\windows\system32\wermgr.exe . Then the exploit instructs us to restore the file.
3:48 - 04:23: We go back to the BitDefender and we restore the file. As we observe, we have to press the restore button two times. The Bitdefender will restore the eicar file and will overwrite the c:\windows\system32\wermgr.exe . The c:\windows\system32\wermgr.exe will have a new DACL which allows us to overwrite it. The exploit will overwrite the c:\windows\system32\wermgr.exe with our binary "1.exe" . At this point the exploit should terminate in a few seconds. If you observe a delay on the exploit, press ENTER a few times.
04:23 - 05:03: As we can see the c:\windows\system32\wermgr.exe has been ovewritten by the 1.exe and the new DACL gives the "attacker" full access over the file.
05:03 - end: This is irrelevant with the BitDefender issue. This just a way to trigger the execution of the file c:\windows\system32\wermgr.exe (which is now the 1.exe) as SYSTEM and gain a shell as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM .
